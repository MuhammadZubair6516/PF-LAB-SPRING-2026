## Introduction  

This lab focuses on understanding and implementing **Nested Decision Structures** in C programming. Nested decisions allow programs to evaluate multiple conditions in a structured and hierarchical manner. These structures help in handling complex logic efficiently while maintaining code readability and organization.

### Topics Covered:
1. **Introduction to Nested Decision Structures**  
2. **Nested If-Else Statements**  
3. **Nested Switch-Case Statements**  
4. **Operators in C**  
5. **Introduction to Math Library Functions**

## Aims  

- **Manage Complex Decision Making**  
  Handle complex decision processes where multiple conditions must be checked in a specific order, often depending on earlier decisions.  

- **Increase Program Flexibility**  
  Enable programs to respond differently based on combinations of multiple conditions.  

- **Create Modular Logic**  
  Build programs that separate logical branches clearly for organized and maintainable code.  

- **Achieve Precise Outcomes**  
  Execute accurate operations by evaluating a sequence of conditions appropriately.

## Objectives  

- **Efficiently Handle Multiple Scenarios**  
  Manage multiple conditions effectively without excessive repetition of code.  

- **Simplify Complex Condition Checking**  
  Break complicated logic into smaller, manageable decision blocks.  

- **Support Hierarchical Decision Logic**  
  Implement decisions that depend on previous outcomes using nested structures.  

- **Optimize Code Readability and Maintenance**  
  Structure programs with clear decision-making paths.  

- **Minimize Redundancy**  
  Reduce duplication of code by reusing common conditions within nested branches.
