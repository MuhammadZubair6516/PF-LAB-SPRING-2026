# PF Lab 4 – Decision Structures in C

## Aim
The aim of this lab is to **learn and implement basic decision structures in C**, enabling logical decision-making in programs. By understanding and using conditions, programs can control the flow of execution, make choices based on different criteria, and become more interactive, functional, and responsive.

---

## Objectives

1. **Understand the Concept of Decision Structures**  
   - Grasp the importance of decision-making in programming and how it controls the flow of a program.

2. **Learn Basic Decision-Making Statements**  
   - Familiarize yourself with the primary decision structures in C, such as `if`, `if-else`, and `switch` statements.

3. **Implement if and if-else Statements**  
   - Use `if` statements to execute code blocks based on a condition.  
   - Use `if-else` statements to handle multiple branches, allowing different actions depending on whether a condition is true or false.

4. **Use switch Statements for Multiple Choices**  
   - Use `switch` statements for scenarios involving multiple possible cases, improving code readability and organization compared to multiple `if-else` conditions.

5. **Understand Relational and Logical Operators**  
   - Gain proficiency in using relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) and logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) to form complex conditions within decision structures.

## Introduction

In this lab, the following topics are covered:

1. Introduction to decision structures  
2. Decision structures using `if`, `if-else`, and `if-else if-else` statements  
3. Handling multiple scenarios using `switch` statements

---

## Files Included

- All programs demonstrating **if**, **if-else**, and **switch** statements  
- Examples showing use of relational and logical operators  

---

## Usage

1. Open the `.c` files in any C IDE or code editor (VS Code, Code::Blocks, Dev C++, etc.).  
2. Compile the programs using a C compiler (GCC or similar).  
3. Run and observe how decision structures control program flow based on different conditions.
