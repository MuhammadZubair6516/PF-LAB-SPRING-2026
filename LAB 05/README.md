📌 Introduction

This lab focuses on understanding and implementing Nested Decision Structures in C programming. Nested decisions allow programs to evaluate multiple conditions in a structured and hierarchical manner. These structures help in handling complex logic efficiently while maintaining code readability and organization.

Topics Covered:

Introduction to Nested Decision Structures

Nested If-Else Statements

Nested Switch-Case Statements

Operators in C

Introduction to Math Library Functions

🎯 Aims

Manage Complex Decision Making
Handle complex decision processes where multiple conditions must be checked in a specific order, often depending on earlier decisions.

Increase Program Flexibility
Enable programs to respond differently based on combinations of multiple conditions.

Create Modular Logic
Build programs that separate logical branches clearly for organized and maintainable code.

Achieve Precise Outcomes
Execute accurate operations by evaluating a sequence of conditions appropriately.

✅ Objectives

Efficiently Handle Multiple Scenarios
Manage multiple conditions effectively without excessive repetition of code.

Simplify Complex Condition Checking
Break complicated logic into smaller, manageable decision blocks.

Support Hierarchical Decision Logic
Implement decisions that depend on previous outcomes using nested structures.

Optimize Code Readability and Maintenance
Structure programs with clear decision-making paths.

Minimize Redundancy
Reduce duplication of code by reusing common conditions within nested branches.

🛠 Tools & Concepts Used

C Programming Language

Conditional Statements (if, if-else, else-if)
